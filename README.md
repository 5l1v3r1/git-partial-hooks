git-partial-hooks
=================

The git partial hooks implementation will allow you to have multiple git hooks separated in files. Just put your pre-commit hooks in pre-commit.d and they will be executed on pre-commit. This will allow you to easier reuse git hooks.
 
You can fork this repository and add your own custom hooks.
